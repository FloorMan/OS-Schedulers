## Description
This project simulates different process scheduling algorithms including First-Come First-Served (FCFS), Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR). The results are displayed in a Tkinter-based GUI, showing the events and process metrics for each scheduler.

## Features
- Simulate FCFS, SJF, and RR scheduling algorithms.
- Display scheduling events and process metrics in a user-friendly GUI.
- Easily select input files through a file dialog.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python on most systems)

## Installation

### Ensure Python and Tkinter are installed
- **On macOS**:
  Tkinter is included with Python on macOS by default. If you encounter any issues, you can install Tkinter via Homebrew:
